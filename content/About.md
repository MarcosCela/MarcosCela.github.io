I am Marcos, a Telecommunications engineer specialized in telematics. I have a decent amount of experience
in programming (Java, Python, Golang, bash...). I love anything that has to do with Containers, specially
Kubernetes and Openshift, and think that it solves a lot of problems in a beautiful and elegant way,
if you can afford the complexity.
When working, I prefer keeping things in a repository and using Ansible if the code has to be somewhere else,
be it configuration, templates, services...
I enjoy programming in simple and not so simple programs and scripts. I also like the "Ops" side of things,
like setting up a K8s cluster, deploying a monitoring and logging stack, playing with Terraform and Ansible...

One of my professional highlights was setting up a OpenStack HA cluster in a baremetal environment using
[openstack-ansible]. It was a lot of work, but I learned so much that even after almost a year later I find
myself thinking "I've seen this before" thanks to that experience.

I am currently trying to improve my "cloud" experience, as I have been working mostly in places with
on-prem infrastructure.
